# Dancher Agent web — pi.cyyu.me 前端（静态 SPA）

pi coding agent 的 web 前端。**纯静态导出**（`output: 'export'`），nginx 直伺服
`web-dist/`，零 Node 进程。API 后端在独立仓库 **pi-server**
（`D:\Programs\pi-server`，Servy 服务 `PiServer`，loopback :30141）——
2026-09-15 拆仓（ADR 0005，历史经 filter-repo 保留在 pi-server）。

## Repo layout

- **packages/shared/src/** — 前端源码唯一事实源：components/、hooks/、lib/
  （浏览器侧 helper：agent-client、markdown、types…）、public/（fonts/icons/
  theme-init.js/sw.js/offline）、styles/、app-src/（真实 layout/page/login/
  manifest）
- **apps/web/** — 静态导出应用薄壳（next.config `output:'export'`，薄入口
  re-export shared）
- Junction（fresh clone 后重建）：`apps/web/node_modules` → 仓库根
  `node_modules`；`apps/web/public` → `packages/shared/src/public`
- `deploy/deploy-web.cmd` — 导出构建 + staged 拷贝（排除 *.test.mjs）+
  web-dist 原子换目录

上游跟踪：本仓保留 agegr/pi-web 的 origin remote 与完整共同历史，是**上游
集成点**——上游更新 merge 进来，服务端相关 delta（app/api、rpc-manager）
人工移植进 pi-server（ADR 0005"Upstream tracking"节）。

## 常用命令

```bash
bun run dev:web    # 开发服务器（.next-dev/，API 调 /api/* 需后端在跑）
bun run build:web  # 静态导出 → apps/web/out/
bun run test       # shared 源码的 node:test 套件
```

bun-only（preinstall 拦 npm/pnpm/yarn）；registry 钉 npmmirror（bunfig.toml）。

## 生产部署（前端）

```
D:\Programs\pi-web\deploy\deploy-web.cmd
```

= build:web → staged 拷贝 → web-dist 换目录。**零重启、零 SSE 中断**，nginx
按请求读新目录。回滚：`rmdir /s /q web-dist && ren web-dist.old web-dist`。

后端部署在 pi-server 仓（`deploy\deploy.cmd` → Servy PiServer）。

## nginx 侧（只读参考，配置在 C:\Users\CyYu\Run\nginx）

- `/` → web-dist 直伺服（CSP 放宽同旧代理块；per-path 缓存：_next/static
  immutable、fonts/icons 7d、sw.js+manifest must-revalidate）
- `/api/` → 127.0.0.1:30141（PiServer）
- 安全三层不动：mTLS（server 级 423 门）→ basic auth → TOTP
  （auth_request /__auth_pi → gateway :21090，pi realm 48h session cookie）

## Tailwind v4 扫描基准

shared 源码不在 apps/web 下，内容扫描靠 styles/app.css 顶部的 `@source`
指令——**勿删**（删了 shared 组件的样式全消失）。

## Session 文件格式（文件查看器用，速查）

`~/.pi/agent/sessions/<encoded-cwd>/<timestamp>_<uuid>.jsonl`；
toolCall 块 `{type:"toolCall",id,name,arguments}` ↔ UI 类型
`{toolCallId,toolName,input}` 的归一化在 lib/normalize.ts。
### AgentSession lifecycle (`lib/rpc-manager.ts`)
- One `AgentSessionWrapper` per session id, keyed in `globalThis.__piSessions`
- `globalThis` survives Next.js hot-reload; plain module-level Map does not
- Idle timeout: 10 minutes by default (`PI_WEB_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS`, `0` disables). Concurrent `startRpcSession()` calls share a single start Promise (`globalThis.__piStartLocks`)

## 跨项目记忆规则

cyyu.me 栈运维事实（nginx/Servy/PiServer/网关）写全局 yinor
（group=default），不写本仓分区——别的目录的会话看不到项目分区。
**Fix**: `send("fork")` captures `newSessionId`, then calls `this.destroy()` before returning. The next request for the original session reloads a clean AgentSession from the original file.

### Two kinds of branching — don't confuse them
- **Fork** ("New session" on user message): creates a new independent `.jsonl` file. Shown as a child in the sidebar tree via `parentSession` header field.
- **In-session branch** ("Edit from here" / BranchNavigator): calls `navigate_tree` within the same file. Multiple entries share the same `parentId`. Switching between them calls `/api/sessions/[id]/context?leafId=`.

### Session files can be fully rewritten
`parentSession` in the header is **display metadata only** — has zero effect on chat content. Safe to `writeFileSync` the entire file (pi does this itself during migrations). Used when cascade-reparenting children on delete.

### ToolCall field normalization
Pi stores toolCall blocks as `{type:"toolCall", id, name, arguments}` but `ToolCallContent` uses `{toolCallId, toolName, input}`. `normalizeToolCalls()` in `lib/normalize.ts` handles this — called in both `session-reader.ts` (file load) and `handleAgentEvent` in `hooks/useAgentSession.ts` (streaming).

### New session tool preset
Tool names are passed at session creation (`POST /api/agent/new` -> `toolNames[]`) and persisted in versioned `pi-web:tool-selection` custom entries. No entry means a legacy session and keeps Pi's default behavior; an empty array means Chat only. Chat only resolves before services are created, loads no extensions/skills/prompts/themes, and replaces Pi's base prompt with the ordered contents of Pi's discovered context files. Crossing the Chat-only boundary rebuilds the wrapper; changing between nonempty presets updates it in place. Subagents persist their active tools plus profile-level skill and extension loading switches in `resourceSnapshot`; loaded extensions cannot expose the reserved `Agent`, `get_subagent_result`, or `steer_subagent` tools to a subagent. See `docs/adr/0002-chat-only-tool-selection.md`.

The last preset explicitly selected by the user is stored in browser `localStorage` and initializes fresh-session composers only. Existing sessions never trust that preference; they use their live `get_tools` state or pi's default when no wrapper exists.

### Model defaults for new sessions
`GET /api/models` returns `defaultModel` read from `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`. `ChatWindow` pre-selects this on mount for new sessions. Explicit browser model/thinking selections are applied atomically during AgentSession construction, then `lib/startup-preferences.ts` persists their effective values without replaying `set_model`/`set_thinking_level`; implicit `enabledModels` fallbacks and thinking pins are not persisted.

### `enabledModels` scoping
The `enabledModels` setting uses pi's `--models` syntax: minimatch globs against `provider/modelId` or a bare `modelId`, fuzzy matching for non-glob patterns, and an optional `:thinkingLevel` suffix. Never compare those patterns as literal strings — `lib/model-scope.ts` delegates to the SDK's `resolveModelScopeWithDiagnostics()` so pi-web and the TUI agree on the visible model list, and falls back to all available models when patterns resolve to nothing. `startRpcSession()` resolves that scope before creating an AgentSession and passes the selected initial model, thinking pin, and SDK-native `scopedModels` atomically; `GET /api/models` reuses the helper only for selector data, `thinkingLevelPins`, and `modelScopeWarnings` display.

### SSE reconnect on page refresh mid-stream
On `ChatWindow` mount, `GET /api/agent/[id]` is called. If `state.isStreaming === true`, SSE is reconnected automatically. `thinkingLevel` and `isCompacting` are also synced from this response.

### Compaction SSE events
Newer pi emits `compaction_start` / `compaction_end`; older versions emitted `auto_compaction_start` / `auto_compaction_end`. `handleAgentEvent` accepts both sets to keep `isCompacting` in sync. Manual compact is a blocking POST — the button stays disabled until the response returns.

### Running state polling + reconciliation
- The sidebar polls `/api/agent/running` every 2.5 seconds while the tab is visible and pauses polling in background tabs. The session-list response remains the initial fallback.
- `useAgentSession` treats per-session SSE as primary for chat events and opens it before each prompt. `prompt_done` completes the current UI stage and notification immediately, but the idle SSE stays open for a 30-second grace window and is reused by the next prompt. `agent_start` cancels that close timer; `agent_settled` finishes extension-injected runs that have no wrapper-level `prompt_done` and starts a fresh grace window. Do not close on the first `agent_end`: retries, compaction, and extension-queued messages can continue the same logical prompt.
- While a run is active, `useAgentSession` periodically calls `GET /api/agent/[id]` and also reconciles on `visibilitychange`/`online`. This fixes missed terminal events from background tabs or half-open connections.
- Prompt runs use a monotonic run id; late SSE or slow reconciliation responses from an old run must be ignored so they cannot resurrect stale streaming bubbles.

### Worktrees and project grouping
- `lib/worktree.ts` resolves linked worktree top-levels back to the main repo `projectRoot`; `listAllSessions()` attaches that to each `SessionInfo` so all worktrees for one repo are grouped together in the sidebar.
- Worktree operations are served by `/api/worktrees` and guarded by the same allowed-root rules as `/api/files`.
- New worktrees are created under `<repoRoot>-worktrees/<sanitized-branch>`. Existing branches are reused; otherwise `git worktree add -b` creates the branch.
- Removing a dirty worktree returns `409` with `{ dirty: true }` so the UI can ask before retrying with `force`.
- Sessions whose cwd points at a removed worktree are inferred back into the main project instead of becoming a phantom project row.
- git prints POSIX-style absolute paths even on Windows, so every path read out of git goes through `toNativePath()` (`lib/paths.ts`) before it is compared or returned. Compare paths with `samePath()`, never `===` — raw equality made `isTopLevel` permanently false on Windows and hid the worktree switcher entirely. Branch names are not paths and must keep their forward slashes. Browser code cannot apply Node path rules, so `/api/worktrees` resolves `currentWorktreePath` server-side; the sidebar must use that identity for highlighting and removal fallback.

### File access allow-list
- `/api/files` is intentionally not a general filesystem browser. Allowed roots come from session cwds, their resolved project roots, `~/pi-cwd-*`, and roots explicitly added with `allowFileRoot()`.
- `/api/cwd/validate`, `/api/default-cwd`, and `/api/worktrees` call `allowFileRoot()` when they make a new location browsable.
- Allowed roots are stored slash-normalized, but that is a Set-key convention, not a correctness requirement: `isPathWithinRoots()` (`lib/path-security.ts`, the single implementation behind `isFilePathAllowed()`) re-resolves and case-folds both sides, so either path form authorizes correctly. Keep that one implementation — it is the security boundary.
- A UNC cwd (`\\host\share\dir`) must survive the `/api/files/[...path]` round-trip. `encodeFilePathForApi()` folds the `//` root into the first segment (`%2F%2Fhost`) because a literal `//` URL prefix is 308-normalized away before routing; `filePathFromApiSegments()` decodes it back. Never split UNC paths into segments and rejoin them — that silently turns `\\host\share` into the relative-looking `host/share` and every allow-check fails with 403.

### Plugins and skills
- `/api/plugins` uses pi's `SettingsManager` + `DefaultPackageManager` for global/project package install, remove, update, enable, and disable. Disabling writes empty `extensions/skills/prompts/themes` arrays for that package entry.
- `/api/skills` uses `DefaultResourceLoader` so settings paths, package skills, and project `.agents/skills` are listed the same way the runtime sees them.
- Skill toggling edits only the `disable-model-invocation` frontmatter key on the target `SKILL.md`; keep that surgical so user formatting survives.
- `/api/skills/install` shells through `npx skills add ... --agent pi`; project installs run with the selected cwd.

### Built-in subagents
- The global `builtInEnabled` switch is persisted in `~/.pi/agent/agents/settings.json` and defaults to `false` when the file or field is absent. Malformed settings fail closed; atomic updates preserve unknown fields.
- The inline built-in extension factory is always present so reloading an existing wrapper can apply setting changes, but it registers no tools while disabled. After changing the switch, the user must explicitly reload the current session.
- When enabled, only a recognized legacy `pi-subagents` extension that registers any reserved tool (`Agent`, `get_subagent_result`, or `steer_subagent`) is removed. Unrelated extensions remain loaded, and resolved conflict diagnostics are discarded.
- Runtime `Agent` dispatch checks the setting again so a stale tool call cannot start a subagent after the feature is switched off.
- See `docs/adr/0003-built-in-subagent-toggle.md` for the precedence and persistence rationale.
- Agent profile files (`~/.pi/agent/agents/*.md`, project `.pi/agents/*.md`) are shared with other runtimes, so a save round-trips the frontmatter keys this app does not own (`name`, `allowed_subagents`, `exclude_extensions`, `disallowed_tools`, …) and carries foreign `ext:` tool selectors through. Managed keys are exactly `description`, `display_name`, `tools`, `load_skills`, `load_extensions`, `enabled`, `inherit_context`, `run_in_background`, `model`, `thinking`, `max_turns`.
- The `skills` / `extensions` spellings pi-subagents reads are seeded on first save and kept in step while they are booleans; a hand-authored whitelist such as `extensions: pi-advisor-flow` is never rewritten, and the two flags fall back to those aliases when `load_skills` / `load_extensions` are absent.

### Web password throttling
- `lib/auth-throttle.ts` is deliberately global, not per-IP: Next 16 route handlers have no socket address and `x-forwarded-for` is spoofable, while the server binds `127.0.0.1` for a single operator. Failures double the delay (1s → 60s cap) for everyone; a success or 5 idle minutes resets it. The reset window must stay longer than the max delay or waiting out one block restarts the burst.
- State lives on `globalThis` under `Symbol.for("pi-web:auth-throttle")` so it survives hot reload and is shared by every module instance. Tests reset it with `recordAuthSuccess()`.
- Only `POST /api/web-auth` is throttled. The Basic auth branch in `proxy.ts` is not, because sharing state between the proxy bundle and route handlers has not been verified.

### Auth and model config
- `ModelsConfig` combines models from `~/.pi/agent/models.json` with provider auth status from pi's `AuthStorage`/`ModelRegistry`.
- Provider listing is capability-driven, never id-driven: `lib/provider-listing.ts` decides membership from `auth.apiKey.login` / `auth.oauth` plus the stored credential type, so dual-auth providers (anthropic and github-copilot today — which providers declare both changes between SDK releases, so never assume it from an id) appear exactly once and never fall through both lists (#309). `lib/provider-listing-runtime.ts` adapts `ModelRuntime` to those pure helpers.
- auth.json holds **one** credential per provider and `ModelRuntime.logout()` deletes whichever it is. The delete routes therefore use `removeStoredCredentialIfType()` to compare and delete under the same file lock used by pi's auth storage. `ModelsConfig` also refreshes *both* provider lists after any auth change — refreshing one leaves a dual-auth provider rendered twice.
- OAuth/device-code/manual-code flows are streamed by `GET /api/auth/login/[provider]`; manual code responses POST back with a short-lived token stored in `globalThis.__piLoginCallbacks`.
- API-key routes store and remove keys through `AuthStorage`. Status endpoints must never return the raw key.
- The model test route is `app/api/models-config/test/route.ts`; `app/api/models/test/` is not a real route.

### Completion sound
- `hooks/useAudio.ts` stores the toggle in `localStorage` as `pi-sound-enabled` and reuses one `AudioContext`.
- Browser autoplay policy means sound must be unlocked from a user gesture; `ChatInput` calls the unlock hook from interactive controls, and `ChatWindow` plays the tone from `onAgentEnd`.

### Exported session HTML
- `/api/sessions/[id]/export` delegates to pi's export helper, then patches recursive tree helpers in the generated HTML to iterative versions so very deep linear sessions do not overflow the browser call stack.

## Pi Session File Format

Location: `~/.pi/agent/sessions/<encoded-cwd>/<timestamp>_<uuid>.jsonl`

```jsonl
{"type":"session","version":3,"id":"<uuid>","timestamp":"...","cwd":"/path","parentSession":"/abs/path/to/parent.jsonl"}
{"type":"model_change","id":"<8hex>","parentId":null,"provider":"zenmux","modelId":"claude-sonnet-4-6","timestamp":"..."}
{"type":"message","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","message":{"role":"user","content":"..."}}
{"type":"message","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","message":{"role":"assistant","content":[...],...}}
{"type":"message","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","message":{"role":"toolResult","toolCallId":"...","content":[...]}}
{"type":"compaction","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","summary":"...","firstKeptEntryId":"<8hex>","tokensBefore":N}
{"type":"session_info","id":"...","parentId":"...","name":"user-defined name"}
```

`entryIds[]` in `SessionContext` is a parallel array to `messages[]` — maps each displayed message back to its `.jsonl` entry id, used for fork and navigate_tree calls.
