# Pi Web - Development Notes

## Quick Start

```bash
# 根路径模式（生产同构，本地开发首选）:
bun run dev   # → http://localhost:30141/
# 生产服务占用 30141 时，换端口：bun run dev -- -p 30199
```

Typecheck: `node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit`  
Lint: `bun run lint`  
Build: `bun run build` — production build (`--webpack`, isolated HOME via deploy/build.mjs; any entrypoint works, no env prep needed).  
Dev/build outputs are SEPARATE since 2026-09-04: `bun run dev` writes `.next-dev/` (via deploy/dev.mjs + PI_WEB_DEV flag), `bun run build` writes `.next/`. They no longer clobber each other, but still avoid running a build while the Servy production service is serving from `.next/` (do a build+restart pair via deploy\deploy.cmd).

### Dev server troubleshooting

- Before starting a server, run `lsof -nP -iTCP:30141 -sTCP:LISTEN` and reuse the existing Pi Web process when it is healthy. Note the production Servy service also binds 30141 — for a local dev server pick another port (`bun run dev -- -p 30199`), dev output lives in `.next-dev/` and cannot touch the production `.next/`.
- A browser-only `Module ... factory is not available` overlay usually means that tab has a stale Turbopack/HMR graph; it does not prove the server or source is broken. First call the browser's explicit reload action, then compare the current server log and a direct HTTP/API request.
- Restart only after the failure reproduces from a fresh page and the server-side checks also fail. Stop the exact dev process gracefully, move `.next-dev` into a `mktemp -d` backup, and restart with the standard `bun run dev` command.
- Do not use `next dev --webpack` as a fallback. This repository's development graph can fail on `undici` imports such as `node:console`; development is expected to use Turbopack.
- Next.js may append a generated `BEGIN:nextjs-agent-rules` block to `AGENTS.md` when `next dev` starts. Treat that as generated tooling output, verify it with `git status`, and do not include it in an unrelated feature commit.

## Production Deployment (PiWeb / pi.cyyu.me)

One command (admin console, from repo root or anywhere):

```
D:\Programs\pi-web\deploy\deploy.cmd
```

Steps it runs: `bun install` → `bun run build` → `servy-cli restart --name=PiWeb`.
Non-admin console: it stops after build and prints the sudo restart line —
finish manually: `sudo servy-cli restart --name=PiWeb`.

### Guardrails (why each piece exists — 2026-09-04 incident)

- **bun-only installs**: `package.json` `preinstall` aborts when `npm_execpath`
  isn't bun (npm/pnpm/yarn). npm rewires `node_modules/.bin` and breaks
  `bun run start` (`could not find bin metadata file`). Do not bypass.
  `package-lock.json` stays tracked ONLY for upstream merge compatibility
  (upstream uses npm); this repo never consumes it — `bun.lock` is canonical.
- **Isolated build HOME**: `bun run build` = `node deploy/build.mjs`, which
  points HOME/USERPROFILE at `.build-home/`. Real profile has legacy junctions
  with Deny ACLs — Next 16 webpack tracing walks them → EPERM or 8 GB OOM.
- **Registry pinned**: `bunfig.toml` fixes npmmirror so `bun install` never
  rewrites `bun.lock` URLs again (the diff stays clean).
- **Fail-fast launcher**: `deploy/start-servy.cmd` (Servy runs it — since
  2026-09-11 as user `.\CyYu`, previously SYSTEM)
  exits 1 with a clear message when `.next/BUILD_ID` is missing, and
  propagates bun's exit code (`endlocal & exit /b %errorlevel%`) so Servy's
  RestartService recovery actually fires. HTTP bindings/env: loopback
  30141, `PI_WEB_HOSTNAME=pi.cyyu.me`, HOME→real profile (session store).
- **Service account (2026-09-11)**: PiWeb runs as `.\CyYu` via Servy's
  native `install --user/--password` (AES-encrypted credential, auto-granted
  service logon right). Consequences: `--recoveryAction RestartProcess`
  only — RestartService is unavailable for user accounts; `servy-cli export`
  writes the password in PLAINTEXT into the exported json, strip it before
  keeping a copy; changing the CyYu account password breaks the service until
  reinstalled with the new password; `%ProgramData%\Servy` needs Modify for
  CyYu (granted). Servy here is 7.0.0 — the v9.7+ `Set-ServyExePermissions.ps1`
  hardening script does not exist for it. Also note RestartService recovery
  in older notes refers to the pre-2026-09-11 SYSTEM setup.
- **dev/build split**: dev writes `.next-dev/`, production serves `.next/`.

### Incident triage cheatsheet

- Service state: `sc query PiWeb`; events: Windows Event Log → Application →
  source `Servy` (start/stop/child-exit with codes).
- App logs: `D:\Programs\pi-web\logs\out.log` / `err.log` — **UTF-16LE**,
  read with an encoding-aware tool (or `iconv -f UTF-16LE`).
- Upstream health: `curl http://127.0.0.1:30141/` (expect 200).
- Through nginx with mTLS: no cert → 423; wrong-CA cert → 400; valid cert +
  no basic auth → 401. All three mean nginx is fine — keep digging upstream.
- Do NOT edit `bun.lock` by hand; if it drifts, `bun install` regenerates.

**Session browsing** (read-only): reads `.jsonl` files through SDK `SessionManager` helpers and `lib/session-reader.ts` — no AgentSession created.  
**Sending a message**: `startRpcSession()` in `lib/rpc-manager.ts` creates an AgentSession in-process.

## Key Design Decisions & Traps

### AgentSession lifecycle (`lib/rpc-manager.ts`)

- One `AgentSessionWrapper` per session id, keyed in `globalThis.__piSessions`
- `globalThis` survives Next.js hot-reload; plain module-level Map does not
- Idle timeout: 10 minutes. Concurrent `startRpcSession()` calls share a single start Promise (`globalThis.__piStartLocks`)

### Fork must destroy the wrapper immediately

`AgentSession.fork()` **mutates the wrapper's inner state in-place** — after fork, `inner.sessionId` is the *new* session's id. If the wrapper stays alive in the registry under the old id, the next request gets the already-forked state and subsequent forks produce a corrupt `parentSession` chain.

**Fix**: `send("fork")` captures `newSessionId`, then calls `this.destroy()` before returning. The next request for the original session reloads a clean AgentSession from the original file.

### Two kinds of branching — don't confuse them

- **Fork** ("New session" on user message): creates a new independent `.jsonl` file. Shown as a child in the sidebar tree via `parentSession` header field.
- **In-session branch** ("Edit from here" / BranchNavigator): calls `navigate_tree` within the same file. Multiple entries share the same `parentId`. Switching between them calls `/api/sessions/[id]/context?leafId=`.

### Session files can be fully rewritten

`parentSession` in the header is **display metadata only** — has zero effect on chat content. Safe to `writeFileSync` the entire file (pi does this itself during migrations). Used when cascade-reparenting children on delete.

### ToolCall field normalization

Pi stores toolCall blocks as `{type:"toolCall", id, name, arguments}` but `ToolCallContent` uses `{toolCallId, toolName, input}`. `normalizeToolCalls()` in `lib/normalize.ts` handles this — called in both `session-reader.ts` (file load) and `handleAgentEvent` in `hooks/useAgentSession.ts` (streaming).

### New session tool preset

Tool names are passed at session creation (`POST /api/agent/new` -> `toolNames[]`) and persisted in versioned `pi-web:tool-selection` custom entries. No entry means a legacy session and keeps Pi's default behavior; an empty array means Chat only. Chat only resolves before services are created, loads no extensions/skills/prompts/themes, and replaces Pi's base prompt with the ordered contents of Pi's discovered context files. Crossing the Chat-only boundary rebuilds the wrapper; changing between nonempty presets updates it in place. Subagents persist their active tools plus profile-level skill and extension loading switches in `resourceSnapshot`; loaded extensions cannot expose the reserved `Agent`, `get_subagent_result`, or `steer_subagent` tools to a subagent. See `docs/adr/0002-chat-only-tool-selection.md`.

The last preset explicitly selected by the user is stored in browser `localStorage` and initializes fresh-session composers only. Existing sessions never trust that preference; they use their live `get_tools` state or pi's default when no wrapper exists.

### Model defaults for new sessions

`GET /api/models` returns `defaultModel` read from `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`. `ChatWindow` pre-selects this on mount for new sessions. Explicit browser model/thinking selections are applied atomically during AgentSession construction, then `lib/startup-preferences.ts` persists their effective values without replaying `set_model`/`set_thinking_level`; implicit `enabledModels` fallbacks and thinking pins are not persisted.

### `enabledModels` scoping

The `enabledModels` setting uses pi's `--models` syntax: minimatch globs against `provider/modelId` or a bare `modelId`, fuzzy matching for non-glob patterns, and an optional `:thinkingLevel` suffix. Never compare those patterns as literal strings — `lib/model-scope.ts` delegates to the SDK's `resolveModelScopeWithDiagnostics()` so pi-web and the TUI agree on the visible model list, and falls back to all available models when patterns resolve to nothing. `startRpcSession()` resolves that scope before creating an AgentSession and passes the selected initial model, thinking pin, and SDK-native `scopedModels` atomically; `GET /api/models` reuses the helper only for selector data, `thinkingLevelPins`, and `modelScopeWarnings` display.

### SSE reconnect on page refresh mid-stream

On `ChatWindow` mount, `GET /api/agent/[id]` is called. If `state.isStreaming === true`, SSE is reconnected automatically. `thinkingLevel` and `isCompacting` are also synced from this response.

### Compaction SSE events

Newer pi emits `compaction_start` / `compaction_end`; older versions emitted `auto_compaction_start` / `auto_compaction_end`. `handleAgentEvent` accepts both sets to keep `isCompacting` in sync. Manual compact is a blocking POST — the button stays disabled until the response returns.

### Running state polling + reconciliation

- The sidebar polls `/api/agent/running` every 2.5 seconds while the tab is visible and pauses polling in background tabs. The session-list response remains the initial fallback.
- `useAgentSession` treats per-session SSE as primary for chat events and opens it before each prompt. `prompt_done` completes the current UI stage and notification immediately, but the idle SSE stays open for a 30-second grace window and is reused by the next prompt. `agent_start` cancels that close timer; `agent_settled` finishes extension-injected runs that have no wrapper-level `prompt_done` and starts a fresh grace window. Do not close on the first `agent_end`: retries, compaction, and extension-queued messages can continue the same logical prompt.
- While a run is active, `useAgentSession` periodically calls `GET /api/agent/[id]` and also reconciles on `visibilitychange`/`online`. This fixes missed terminal events from background tabs or half-open connections.
- Prompt runs use a monotonic run id; late SSE or slow reconciliation responses from an old run must be ignored so they cannot resurrect stale streaming bubbles.

### Worktrees and project grouping

- `lib/worktree.ts` resolves linked worktree top-levels back to the main repo `projectRoot`; `listAllSessions()` attaches that to each `SessionInfo` so all worktrees for one repo are grouped together in the sidebar.
- Worktree operations are served by `/api/worktrees` and guarded by the same allowed-root rules as `/api/files`.
- New worktrees are created under `<repoRoot>-worktrees/<sanitized-branch>`. Existing branches are reused; otherwise `git worktree add -b` creates the branch.
- Removing a dirty worktree returns `409` with `{ dirty: true }` so the UI can ask before retrying with `force`.
- Sessions whose cwd points at a removed worktree are inferred back into the main project instead of becoming a phantom project row.
- git prints POSIX-style absolute paths even on Windows, so every path read out of git goes through `toNativePath()` (`lib/paths.ts`) before it is compared or returned. Compare paths with `samePath()`, never `===` — raw equality made `isTopLevel` permanently false on Windows and hid the worktree switcher entirely. Branch names are not paths and must keep their forward slashes. Browser code cannot apply Node path rules, so `/api/worktrees` resolves `currentWorktreePath` server-side; the sidebar must use that identity for highlighting and removal fallback.

### File access allow-list

- `/api/files` is intentionally not a general filesystem browser. Allowed roots come from session cwds, their resolved project roots, `~/pi-cwd-*`, and roots explicitly added with `allowFileRoot()`.
- `/api/cwd/validate`, `/api/default-cwd`, and `/api/worktrees` call `allowFileRoot()` when they make a new location browsable.
- Allowed roots are stored slash-normalized, but that is a Set-key convention, not a correctness requirement: `isPathWithinRoots()` (`lib/path-security.ts`, the single implementation behind `isFilePathAllowed()`) re-resolves and case-folds both sides, so either path form authorizes correctly. Keep that one implementation — it is the security boundary.

### Plugins and skills

- `/api/plugins` uses pi's `SettingsManager` + `DefaultPackageManager` for global/project package install, remove, update, enable, and disable. Disabling writes empty `extensions/skills/prompts/themes` arrays for that package entry.
- `/api/skills` uses `DefaultResourceLoader` so settings paths, package skills, and project `.agents/skills` are listed the same way the runtime sees them.
- Skill toggling edits only the `disable-model-invocation` frontmatter key on the target `SKILL.md`; keep that surgical so user formatting survives.
- `/api/skills/install` shells through `npx skills add ... --agent pi`; project installs run with the selected cwd.

### Built-in subagents

- The global `builtInEnabled` switch is persisted in `~/.pi/agent/agents/settings.json` and defaults to `false` when the file or field is absent. Malformed settings fail closed; atomic updates preserve unknown fields.
- The inline built-in extension factory is always present so reloading an existing wrapper can apply setting changes, but it registers no tools while disabled. After changing the switch, the user must explicitly reload the current session.
- When enabled, only a recognized legacy `pi-subagents` extension that registers any reserved tool (`Agent`, `get_subagent_result`, or `steer_subagent`) is removed. Unrelated extensions remain loaded, and resolved conflict diagnostics are discarded.
- Runtime `Agent` dispatch checks the setting again so a stale tool call cannot start a subagent after the feature is switched off.
- See `docs/adr/0003-built-in-subagent-toggle.md` for the precedence and persistence rationale.
- Agent profile files (`~/.pi/agent/agents/*.md`, project `.pi/agents/*.md`) are shared with other runtimes, so a save round-trips the frontmatter keys this app does not own (`name`, `allowed_subagents`, `exclude_extensions`, `disallowed_tools`, …) and carries foreign `ext:` tool selectors through. Managed keys are exactly `description`, `display_name`, `tools`, `load_skills`, `load_extensions`, `enabled`, `inherit_context`, `run_in_background`, `model`, `thinking`, `max_turns`.
- The `skills` / `extensions` spellings pi-subagents reads are seeded on first save and kept in step while they are booleans; a hand-authored whitelist such as `extensions: pi-advisor-flow` is never rewritten, and the two flags fall back to those aliases when `load_skills` / `load_extensions` are absent.

### Auth and model config

- `ModelsConfig` combines models from `~/.pi/agent/models.json` with provider auth status from pi's `AuthStorage`/`ModelRegistry`.
- Provider listing is capability-driven, never id-driven: `lib/provider-listing.ts` decides membership from `auth.apiKey.login` / `auth.oauth` plus the stored credential type, so dual-auth providers (anthropic and github-copilot today — which providers declare both changes between SDK releases, so never assume it from an id) appear exactly once and never fall through both lists (#309). `lib/provider-listing-runtime.ts` adapts `ModelRuntime` to those pure helpers.
- auth.json holds **one** credential per provider and `ModelRuntime.logout()` deletes whichever it is. The delete routes therefore use `removeStoredCredentialIfType()` to compare and delete under the same file lock used by pi's auth storage. `ModelsConfig` also refreshes *both* provider lists after any auth change — refreshing one leaves a dual-auth provider rendered twice.
- OAuth/device-code/manual-code flows are streamed by `GET /api/auth/login/[provider]`; manual code responses POST back with a short-lived token stored in `globalThis.__piLoginCallbacks`.
- API-key routes store and remove keys through `AuthStorage`. Status endpoints must never return the raw key.
- The model test route is `app/api/models-config/test/route.ts`; `app/api/models/test/` is not a real route.

### Completion sound

- `hooks/useAudio.ts` stores the toggle in `localStorage` as `pi-sound-enabled` and reuses one `AudioContext`.
- Browser autoplay policy means sound must be unlocked from a user gesture; `ChatInput` calls the unlock hook from interactive controls, and `ChatWindow` plays the tone from `onAgentEnd`.

### Exported session HTML

- `/api/sessions/[id]/export` delegates to pi's export helper, then patches recursive tree helpers in the generated HTML to iterative versions so very deep linear sessions do not overflow the browser call stack.

## Pi Session File Format

Location: `~/.pi/agent/sessions/<encoded-cwd>/<timestamp>_<uuid>.jsonl`

```jsonl
{"type":"session","version":3,"id":"<uuid>","timestamp":"...","cwd":"/path","parentSession":"/abs/path/to/parent.jsonl"}
{"type":"model_change","id":"<8hex>","parentId":null,"provider":"zenmux","modelId":"claude-sonnet-4-6","timestamp":"..."}
{"type":"message","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","message":{"role":"user","content":"..."}}
{"type":"message","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","message":{"role":"assistant","content":[...],...}}
{"type":"message","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","message":{"role":"toolResult","toolCallId":"...","content":[...]}}
{"type":"compaction","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","summary":"...","firstKeptEntryId":"<8hex>","tokensBefore":N}
{"type":"session_info","id":"...","parentId":"...","name":"user-defined name"}
```

`entryIds[]` in `SessionContext` is a parallel array to `messages[]` — maps each displayed message back to its `.jsonl` entry id, used for fork and navigate_tree calls.

## Cross-project memory rule (2026-09-04)

Operational facts about the cyyu.me stack (nginx / pi-web / Servy / gateway —
restart procedures, incident root causes, port ownership rules) must be written
to the **global** yinor partition (`group=default`), not this project's
partition. Sessions in other directories (e.g. `~/.pi`, `Run/nginx`) cannot see
project-partition facts — the 09-04 503 outage happened because two partitions
each held half of the truth.

After ANY restart/deploy of pi-web, verify hand-back:
`netstat -ano | findstr :30141` → owning PID must be a child of the Servy
PiWeb service. If a manually-started `next start` survived (restart.cmd path),
kill it and `sudo servy-cli restart --name=PiWeb`, then re-verify.
